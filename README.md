# Scope Challenge
Fix the code so there are no Errors (x)

### Instructions
Download this entire respository or use git clone.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/drjonesy/JS-Scope-Challenge.git 
```
Once the respository is downloaded, open **SpecRunner.html** in a browser. 

In the browser you will see **Function Exercises** with a single check-mark and bunch of (x)'s. The errors refer to code that needs to be fixed.

Now in a text editor like **Sublime Text**, **Notepad++**, or your own personal choice. Open the **functions.js** file. _(it is recommended to use a syntax highliting editor)_

In **functions.js** you need to fix the code so the errors dissappear. You may only change the **'???'** value

```javascript
expect(ACTUAL === '???').to.be.true;
```

The value can be a **number, a string, null,** or **undefined**

```javascript
ex: 'string', 2, null, undefined
```

In the browser, **SpecRunner.html**, clicking on the Text Error will display the current code that needs to be fixed. 

## NOT ALLOWED
You are not allowed to change any of the code in **functions.js**, except for the value: '???'
